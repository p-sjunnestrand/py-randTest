# randint() test

Tests the Python method `randint()` to see whether or not it is skewed towards certain numbers. 

When run, the test take two input values: 
1. The maximum range:
        The test will be run from 0 up to and including the entered number.
2. The sample size:
    This is the number of random integers will be generated for the test.
    The more the merrier.

The test generates a number of integers in the range specified, using the `randint()` method. It then counts the number of occurences of each integer and finally displays the results together with a graphical representation of each integer.
